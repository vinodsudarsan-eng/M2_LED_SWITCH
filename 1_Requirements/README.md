# Introduction
Blinking of LED is a simple project in Embedded progamming world. There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. You can make one using relays. You can        make one using transistors. Or you can make one using components like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. Here swtich is used to blink the two LED using  ATmega328(a microcontroller).
# Objective
The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Components used
1.ATmega328   

2.Two LED 

3.Switch

4.Resistor
# software used
1.simulIDe

2.Visual Studie Code
# Research
Atmega328 is an Atmel microcontroller, which is used in Arduino UNO board.Atmega328 has 28 pins in total. It has 3 Ports in total which are named as Port B,Port  C and Port D.Port C is an analogue Port and it has six pins in total. So, in simple words, ATmega328 has 6 analogue pins.Port B and Port D are digital ports and have 7 pins each.So, in total ATmega328 has 14 digital pins. It also supports Serial Communications, we can perform serial communication via Pin  2 (RX) and Pin 3 (TX).It also supports SPI Protocol.
